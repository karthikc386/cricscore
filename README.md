# CricScore - Web-Based Cricket Scorer

A single-page web application built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), and vanilla JavaScript for detailed ball-by-ball cricket score tracking, including basic bowler statistics.

## Features

*   **Real-time Scoreboard:** Displays Runs/Wickets, Overs bowled (e.g., 10.3), current Run Rate, and Balls Remaining in the current over.
*   **Ball-by-Ball Visualization:** Represents each ball bowled in an over using distinctly colored "pills" indicating the event type (Run, Wicket, Wide, No-ball, Bye, Leg Bye, Penalty).
*   **Comprehensive Event Handling:**
    *   Standard Runs (0-6, plus custom values via "Other" input with configurable ranges).
    *   Wickets (with optional runs off the same delivery).
    *   Extras: Wides, No-balls, Byes, Leg Byes (with associated runs).
    *   Penalty Runs.
    *   **Complex Events:** Handles combined events directly through the modal interface:
        *   Wicket + Wide (+ Runs)
        *   Wicket + No-ball (+ Runs)
        *   Wicket + Bye (+ Runs)
        *   Wicket + Leg Bye (+ Runs)
        *   No-ball + Bye (+ Runs)
        *   No-ball + Leg Bye (+ Runs)
    *   **Free Hit Indicator:** Automatically flags the next delivery as a Free Hit (visually indicated by a cyan border on the ball pill) after a No-ball is recorded. Includes a browser alert.
*   **Over Management:**
    *   Automatically starts a new over after 6 legal deliveries (runs, wickets, byes, leg byes count; wides and no-balls do not).
    *   Displays runs scored in each over alongside the bowler's name.
    *   Assign and track bowlers for each over. Ability to add new bowler names dynamically via the "Set Bowler" modal.
*   **Bowling Statistics:**
    *   View basic bowling figures via a dedicated "Bowling" modal.
    *   Shows Overs (completed 6-ball overs), Runs conceded, Wickets taken, Wides bowled, and No-balls bowled for each bowler used.
*   **History View:** Toggleable display ("Show History" / "Hide History") to show or hide details of previously completed overs, keeping the current and potentially the last over visible by default.
*   **Undo Functionality:** Reverts the *last recorded action* (ball event or bowler change), restoring the previous state using a history stack.
*   **Reset Game:** Clears the entire match progress, including saved data, and starts a fresh game. Requires confirmation.
*   **Session Persistence:** Uses the browser's `localStorage` to save the complete game state (scores, overs bowled, ball-by-ball details, bowler assignments, history stack). Allows closing the browser/tab and resuming the scoring session later.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes using Bootstrap 5.
*   **Sidebar Menu:** Basic navigation structure using Bootstrap Offcanvas (currently minimal).

## How to Use

1.  **Set Bowler:** Before starting an over (or during), click "Set Bowler". Select an existing bowler from the dropdown or click "Add New Bowler" to enter a name. Click "Save". The bowler's name will appear next to the over number.
2.  **Record Events:**
    *   Click **Dot** for a delivery with no run (counts as a legal ball).
    *   Click **Run**, **Wicket**, **Wide**, **No-ball**, **Bye**, **Leg Bye**, or **Penalty** to open a modal specific to that event.
    *   In the modal:
        *   Select a predefined value button (e.g., 1, 4, Wicket+0).
        *   For **Wicket** or **No-ball**, additional buttons appear to record complex events (like "Wide + Wicket + Runs" or "No-ball + Byes"). Clicking these may open *another* modal layer for run selection if applicable.
        *   Use the "Other" input field for values not listed (within specified ranges) and click "Add".
    *   The corresponding ball pill will be added to the current over, and the scoreboard will update.
3.  **View Bowling Stats:** Click the "Bowling" button to open a modal displaying the current statistics (O, R, W, WD, NB) for each bowler.
4.  **Manage History:** Click "Show History" to view all past overs. Click "Hide History" to collapse the view to only the most recent overs.
5.  **Undo/Reset:** Use the "Undo" button to correct the last entry. Use the "Reset" button (with confirmation) to start a completely new game (this clears saved data).

## Technical Details

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Framework/Library:** Bootstrap 5 (for UI components, layout, modals, offcanvas)
*   **State Management:** Vanilla JavaScript variables, objects, and arrays. Includes a history stack for undo functionality.
*   **Persistence:** Browser's `localStorage` API (stores a JSON representation of the game state, including the history stack).
*   **Dynamic UI:** Direct DOM manipulation to add over details, ball pills, update scoreboard text content, and populate modals.
*   **Bowling Stats Calculation:** Stats are generated by parsing the dynamically created HTML elements (over divs and ball pills) in the DOM when the "Bowling" modal is opened.

## Potential Future Improvements

*   Track batting team and individual batsmen scores.
*   Implement innings tracking (1st/2nd innings).
*   Set a target score for the chasing team.
*   Full Free Hit rule implementation (e.g., restricting dismissal types on a free hit delivery).
*   More detailed statistics (economy rates, strike rates, maiden overs explicitly marked).
*   Option to define team names and player lists beforehand.
*   Export/Import game data.
*   Improve robustness of stats calculation (less reliance on parsing rendered HTML).
*   Convert to a Progressive Web App (PWA) for better offline use and installation.
